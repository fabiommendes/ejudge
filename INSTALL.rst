Dependencies
============

PyJudge works only in Python 3 and has no additional dependencies.


Installation commands
=====================

If you downloaded a compressed package, simply unpack it and execute the 
regular Python install::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This package is also available at PyPI and hence can be installed using `pip`::

    $ sudo pip install pyjudge

In Windows the command would be something like this (adapt for the correct 
Python installation path)::

    $ cd c:\python34
    $ python -m pip install pyjudge
